h1. Central Dispatch

Central Dispatch is a totally awesome replacement for JSONP. It allows for
caching of JSON data and relies on a central dispatch handler on the client side
to ensure the correct callback function receives the correct data. Right now
it's terribly incomplete, but you can see the specs to get an idea of where it's
heading. kthx
